# DeepQL

I expect this to eventually grow into a full-stack compiler for webapps. part of a pie-in-sky-project we're building.

## What is it?

Take a specification, run it through the compiler, and a full-stack web application pops out, 
with a React-style front-end, a REST api server, and all of the schema required to bootstrap your database.
